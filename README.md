**Project Description: Trivial Pursuit with Machine Learning**

The "Trivial Pursuit" project aims to develop a machine learning program to assist an agent in capturing a target that moves unpredictably among nodes within a network. The agent has no prior knowledge of the target's movement patterns, making this a challenging task requiring real-time decision-making.

**Objective:**
- Design an intelligent agent capable of learning and adapting its strategies to capture a target moving among nodes in a network.
  
**Approach:**
- **Graph Representation**: The network of nodes will be represented as a graph, where each node represents a location.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Implement RL algorithms such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to enable the agent to learn optimal actions based on rewards and penalties.
  
- **Observation Space**: The agent's observation space includes the current node, neighboring nodes, and historical movements of the target.
  
- **Action Space**: Actions include moving to adjacent nodes, waiting, or employing specific capture strategies.
  
- **Reward System**: Define a reward system where the agent receives positive rewards for capturing the target and negative rewards for wrong moves or delays.
  
- **Training Phase**:
  - Initial training involves the agent exploring the graph to learn the target's movement patterns.
  - Implement exploration-exploitation strategies to balance learning new information and exploiting known strategies.
  
- **Testing Phase**:
  - Evaluate the agent's performance in a simulated environment with the target moving unpredictably.
  - Measure metrics such as capture rate, time to capture, and efficiency of node exploration.
  
**Components:**
  
1. **State Representation**:
   - Node features: Position, connectivity with other nodes.
   - Target movement history.
  
2. **Action Selection**:
   - Based on learned Q-values (DQN) or policy probabilities (PPO).
   - Dynamic actions to adapt to changing target behavior.
  
3. **Reward Design**:
   - Reward for capturing the target.
   - Penalty for incorrect moves or delays.
   - Exploration bonuses to encourage node exploration.
  
4. **Model Training**:
   - Iterative training using RL algorithms.
   - Fine-tuning based on simulation results.
  
5. **Simulation Environment**:
   - Simulation of target movement using random or predefined patterns.
   - Real-time updates of target position.
  
**Expected Outcomes:**
  
- A trained agent capable of effectively capturing a moving target in a graph-based network.
- Improved performance over time through continuous learning and adaptation.
- Insights into optimal strategies for capturing targets in dynamic and unpredictable environments.
  
**Benefits:**
  
- Practical applications in surveillance, security, and search-and-rescue operations.
- Transferable knowledge to similar scenarios with dynamic target tracking.
- Demonstrates the power of machine learning in addressing complex real-world problems with uncertain and evolving conditions.

This project not only serves as a technical challenge in machine learning and reinforcement learning but also has practical implications in various domains where efficient target tracking in dynamic environments is crucial.
